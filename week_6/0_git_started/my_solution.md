## Release 5: Reflection

I really like working with Git. A few years ago I worked for a company that made us use
Mercurial, and that was a pain in the butt compared to Git. I've been using Git for a 
little while (I'm embarassed to admit how many times I've used the reset command) and
I look forward to continuing its use.
